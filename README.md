# React Employee Directory

https://cryptic-lowlands-31610.herokuapp.com/

An app for displaying a database of employees (used a database of Superheroes to make it more fun) with the ability to search by superhero name as well as organize list by various criteria.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Bring up the cloned folder in your terminal and run "npm i" to install the required dependencies

Example of how the employee directory reorganizes based on various clicked criteria.  When organized by stats, the unknowns are always kept to the bottom of the list.  When organizing by alignment, the neutrals always appear in the middle.  When a search is typed in (with autosuggested names), the directory changes to only those with names containing the searched entry.
